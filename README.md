Roll a six-sided die by default, or roll a custom die of up to one-hundred sides.

Any version distributed elsewhere is not provided nor supported by me.

## Building

Roll-It is built using GTK4 and libadwaita with the GNOME HIG in mind.

If you would like to build and hack on Roll-It, it is highly recommended to use [GNOME Builder](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-builder/).

Manual build instructions to come later.
