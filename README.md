## Roll the dice

Simulate the results of rolling a die. Roll a six-sided die by default, or get the results of rolling a custom die with up to one-hundred sides.

## Installation

Roll-It's latest stable release is available via the [elementary OS] AppCenter.

[![Get it on AppCenter](https://appcenter.elementary.io/badge.svg)][AppCenter link]

There is currently no stable release for the new GTK4/libadwaita version.

Any version distributed elsewhere is not provided nor supported by me.

## Building

Roll-It has been rewritten for GTK4 and libadwaita, aligning more with GNOME's HIG. This version is under active development, although there are still plans to build GTK4 Roll-It on the elementary OS platform in the future.

### Flatpak

For the current development build, make sure you have the required Flatpak remote enabled:

```shell
flatpak remote-add --if-not-exists --user gnome-nightly https://nightly.gnome.org/gnome-nightly.flatpakrepo
```

From there, it is highly recommended to use [GNOME Builder](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-builder/) to build and test Roll-It.

Instructions for building the Flatpak manually will come later.
