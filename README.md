The latest stable release of Roll-It is available via Flathub.

<a href='https://flathub.org/apps/details/dev.zelikos.rollit'><img width='240' alt='Download on Flathub' src='https://dl.flathub.org/assets/badges/flathub-badge-en.png'/></a>

Any version distributed elsewhere is not provided nor supported by me.

## Building

Roll-It is built using GTK4 and libadwaita with the [GNOME HIG](https://developer.gnome.org/hig/) in mind.

If you would like to build and hack on Roll-It, it is highly recommended to use [GNOME Builder](https://flathub.org/apps/org.gnome.Builder).

Manual build instructions to come later.
