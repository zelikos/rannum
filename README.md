Any version distributed elsewhere is not provided nor supported by me.

## Building

Chance is built using GTK4 and libadwaita with the [GNOME HIG](https://developer.gnome.org/hig/) in mind.

If you would like to build and hack on Chance, it is highly recommended to use [GNOME Builder](https://flathub.org/apps/org.gnome.Builder).

Manual build instructions to come later.
